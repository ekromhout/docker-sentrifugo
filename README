# Sentrifugo and Mariadb Docker Containers

This is a set of docker files to create
an instance of sentrifugo for testing
along with a mariadb to support it

You can build and run the needed containers via

docker-compose up -d

If this successful you should be albe to
walk though the configuration wizard via

http://localhost:8080

Substituting your docker host for localhost as required

When the wizard asks for database configuraton, use
mariadb for the hostname, sentrifugo for both the
database name and username, and 54y6RxN7GfC7aes3 for
the password. Username, database name, and password can
be changed to your own values by editing Dockerfile-sentrifugo
before running docker-compose
